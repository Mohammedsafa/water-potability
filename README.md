# water-potability
- Water is essential for life, but some water is not suitable for drinking, water quality can be affected by many factors, such as pollution, contamination, and so on. So, it's important to test the water quality before using it for drinking or other purposes.
- In this project, we will use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can classify water samples as potable or not based on some numeric features, We will use dataset called "water_potability" that contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. We will perform exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and modeling using different algorithms. We will also evaluate and compare the performance of our models and make predictions on test data.
