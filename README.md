# water-potability
- Water is essential for life, but some water is not suitable for drinking, water quality can be affected by many factors, such as pollution, contamination, and so on. So, it's important to test the water quality before using it for drinking or other purposes.
-This project tackles the crucial issue of water potability. Clean water is essential for life, but factors like pollution and contamination can compromise its safety. This project utilizes machine learning to build a model that predicts whether water samples are suitable for drinking.
Leveraging a dataset named "water_potability" containing water quality metrics from 3276 water sources, the project employs machine learning techniques for various stages:

-- Unveiling the Data: Exploratory data analysis delves into the dataset to understand its characteristics.
-- Data Preparation: Preprocessing ensures the data is in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
-- Building the Model: Different machine learning algorithms are explored to create a model capable of classifying water samples as potable or non-potable based on their numeric features.
-- Model Evaluation: The project rigorously evaluates and compares the performance of these models to select the most accurate one.
-- Predicting the Future: The final model can then be used to predict the potability of new water samples, safeguarding public health.
